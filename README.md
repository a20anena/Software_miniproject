This project is an R package for analysing RNA-seq data.

The package can:
- import RNA-seq count data
- filter low expressed genes
- perform differential expression analysis using edgeR
- perform GO and KEGG over-representation analysis
- create plots for enrichment results

The package was tested on the E-MTAB-2523 colorectal cancer RNA-seq dataset.
